My name is Sam Ballas and I am currently a postdoc in math at UC Santa Barbara. I am trying to learn about machine learning and data science and figured the best way is to just dig in and get my hands dirty. I'm going to try to share what happens along the way. You can also check out my professional site [here](http://math.ucsb.edu/~sballas) if you are interested in my math
